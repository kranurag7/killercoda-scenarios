- KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operation) of containers and nodes (VMs) at the system level.
- Kubearmor leverages LSMs under the hood. 
- You define the policies in Kubernetes native YAML manifests. 
- kubearmor make sure that the appropriate policies are applied on every node. During the operation, kubearmor takes Linux version, LSMs on the node & their versions in consideration. 
- You don't have to write apparmor profiles & SELinux policies which requires a steep learning curve.
